# Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This project showcases my work and skills as a web developer, encompassing both frontend and backend development.

## Project Overview

This portfolio is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. The visual design, including zoning, wireframes, and mockups, was created by me using Figma. The backend is powered by Node.js and Express.js, providing a basic backoffice functionality.

## Features

- **Frontend:**
  - **HTML & CSS:** Structured and styled the content.
  - **JavaScript:** Added interactivity and dynamic behavior.
  - **Design:** All UI/UX aspects, including buttons and layout, designed in Figma.

- **Backend:**
  - **Node.js & Express.js:** Basic backend setup for potential backoffice functionalities.
  - **Backoffice:** Although not currently in use, it is available for future enhancements.

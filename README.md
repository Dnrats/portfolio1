Nothing much to say. Just a portfolio

# Tools
Mainly HTML and CSS. Eventually I'll add some animations. So far I used JavaScript only for contact form, to avoid using PHP.
Update v1.0 Javascript is used to flip cards. Update v1.1 I used Express.js, Node.js and MySQL for backend, as weird as it sounds i have a backend in portfolio.
Update v1.2 I used Smtp.js for the contact form. Update v1.3 I changed Smtp.js to web3forms.com
